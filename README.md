# Model
We are using transfer learning method when training the models. We use 2 pre-trained model:
## InceptionV3
InceptionV3 is a pre-trained model that has been trained on million of images which make it able to learn a lot of pattern on image. We can use this as a base model so that we don't have to trained our own model from scratch, thus reducing training time and complexcity.

## InceptionResNetV2
This is also a pre-trained model that has been trained on millions of images.
